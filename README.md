# ARDUINO Avans

This is a project to get familiar with Arduino and to learn it. In this project, I created 6 circuits with some code behind it. I'll walk you trough with how I did this.

### Getting Started
I put the code of all circuits and their corresponding pictures in an assignment folder (Ranging from 1 to 6). Simply just set them up and it should work.

### Prequistes
- Arduino Uno (It's what this project was done on)
- M-M cables
- F-M cables
- Breadboard (Not necessary)
- Arduino IDE
- C++ knowledge
- LEDs
- 220 ohm resistors
- Button
- Potentio meter
- Heat sensor
- RGB Led (mine had built in resistors)

## Assignment 1
For this assignment I had to connect 2 LED's on port 11 and 12. These LED's had to flicker alternatively.
